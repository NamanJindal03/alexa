Your skill does not meet the necessary requirements and we were not able to complete a full review of your skill since your skill does not function properly in its current state.
When invoking the skill with one or more of the intent(s) or sample utterances, the skill’s response is irrelevant to the request or contains an error. 

Steps To Reproduce:

User: "Alexa, play rock paper scissors lizard spock"
Skill: "Welcome, you can directly play the game or ask for rules. Which would you like to try?"
User: "play sheldon game"
Skill: "You are in for a great game - ready? 3...2...1... rock"
User: "paper"
Skill: "The game is an expansion on the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. Each player picks a variable and reveals it at the same time...Spock vaporizes Rock and as it always has Rock crushes Scissors"

Please note that the skill provides an irrelevant response when users say any variable (rock, paper, scissor, lizard, spock) instead of proceeding with the game.

Please see our Submission Checklist for guidance on intent responses.
Additional, please refer to our documentation regarding the implementation of Built-in Intents.
The skill does not return a help prompt that instructs users on how to navigate further into the skill’s core functionality. 

Steps to Reproduce:

Skill: "Welcome, you can directly play the game or ask for rules. Which would you like to try?"
